# Complex Research Idea Generator
This is a python script that can run on your laptop, it is aimed to generate 10 new ideas to research each week, however you can customize the script to send a custom number of ideas every how many days you wish [see below for more details]. It then displays them in a window on your laptop, Allowing you to see ur list of ideas from a pool of combinations so large that the probablity of getting a duplicate in a lifetime of 80 years running this every day with a set amount of 10 per day, is 0.00000102%.

### Amount of ideas
It has around 4.169 quintillion possible combinations of ideas from topics like:
- Electronics
- Mechanics
- Physics
- Software Engineering
- Biomechanics
- Bioelectromechanical Systems
- Quantum Computing
- Nanotechnology
- Advanced Materials
- Aerospace Engineering
- Energy Systems
- Biotechnology
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robotics
- Computational Neuroscience
- Cyber-Physical Systems
- Genomic Engineering
- Advanced Robotics and Automation
- Materials Science at the Nanoscale
- Theoretical Physics
- Electromechanical Systems
- Quantum Electronics
- Computational Mechanics
- Control Systems Engineering
- Photonics Engineering
- Microsystems Engineering
- High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- Complexity Theory
- Astrophysics
- Thermodynamics
- Nonlinear Dynamics
- Advanced Numerical Methods
- Nano-Electromechanical Systems (NEMS)
- Nanobots
- Electrodynamics
- Cybernetics
- Quantum Information Theory
- Biomechanical Engineering
- Materials Science
- Space-Time Geometry

### Running the script
It is using python, with a list of API's [see below] to run however it shouldn't need to download any packges as it only uses built in packages

#### API's
```python
import random
import hashlib
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import os
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import scrolledtext
```
